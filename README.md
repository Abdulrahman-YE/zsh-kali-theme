# zsh-kali-theme
A simple way to configure your zsh shell to look like the well known kali zsh configuration. It is tested in ubuntu.
The script will install zsh , zsh-syntax-highlighting, and zsh-autosuggestions.The  [zshrc-config](/zshrc-config) is the same as [kali zshrc](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/kali-defaults/-/blob/kali/master/etc/skel/.zshrc) but with minor changes of the paths to zsh-syntax-highlighting and zsh-autosuggestions.

`git clone https://github.com/Abdulrahman-YE/zsh-kali-theme.git`
- `cd zsh-kali-theme`
- Run the script with your username to configure zsh as default shell
